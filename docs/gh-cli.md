4. **GitHub Actions**: Trigger and manage GitHub Actions workflows directly from the command line.

5. **Gist Creation and Management**: Create, list, edit, and delete Gists (short snippets of code or text) from the command line.

6. **Workflow Automation**: Automate common tasks and workflows using scripts and shell commands with GitHub CLI.

7. **Status Checks**: View the status of checks and workflows associated with pull requests or commits.

8. **Interactivity**: Benefit from an interactive command-line experience with prompts and menus for selecting options and providing input.

9. **Authentication and Authorization**: Authenticate to GitHub and authorize access to repositories securely from the command line.

10. **Customization**: Customize GitHub CLI with aliases and configuration settings to streamline workflows and improve efficiency.

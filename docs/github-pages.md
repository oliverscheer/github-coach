# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub Enterprise Server, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. 

It is a public webpage hosted and published through GitHub

You can find my GitHub Pages project here:
